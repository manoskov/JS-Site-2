# My Second Interactive Site with JavaScript

My name is Mike and I'm studying web-development with Codecademy.com.

This project shows what JS-features I can use right now.

It includes:
* Light/dark theme
* Text with adjustable number of columns 
* Random numbers/facts generator
* Interactive gallery

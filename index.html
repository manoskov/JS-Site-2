        <p>In the first chapter of Malcolm Gladwell’s blockbuster book Blink, I was portrayed as an amazingly wise
            expert on relationships—someone who could see the secrets of a relationship after just a moments’ glance. He
            called it “thin slicing” a relationship in conflict.
            Because of his bestseller, I was suddenly catapulted to the international stage. That turned out to be a
            mixed blessing. Many people subsequently called my lab to have their relationships evaluated and “thin
            sliced.” They wanted me to tell them if their relationship was doomed or if it was going to survive. I tried
            to tell these people that although our studies had allowed us to predict and understand relationships, our
            prediction was only statistical, and we couldn’t predict accurately in every single case. Still, people were
            desperate for advice about their relationships. They wanted both understanding and hope.
            Another outcome of Gladwell’s book was that I, along with my wife Dr. Julie Schwartz Gottman, was invited to
            do a series of articles for Reader’s Digest. This project involved having couples come into my lab once a
            month for “thin slicing” analysis and brief interventions designed to help them transform their marriages.
